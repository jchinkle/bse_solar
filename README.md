Blue Sky Energy Solar Graphs

This website takes the output from the CSV files produced by the Blue Sky Energy Universal Control Module (BSE UCM) and plots that output on a graph.  I've only added the Max Amps and the Amp Hours per time interval.  I also have 2 charge controllers, so it hard codes the use of those for now.  If I get a wild hair I'll update it to work with up to 8 charge controllers, and have it skip the ones not reporting data (offline/not connected)

For now, this suits my needs well though.
